# Buffers, Concurrency and Wikipedia

This mini-project involves interacting with Wikipedia and performing many operations.

Some of the learning goals for this project are:

* Working with external libraries (such as `jwiki` ,`gson`, and `antlr`);
* Implementing reusable datatypes such as a `FSFTBuffer`;
* Using multi-threading to handle certain aspects of the implementation;
* Managing shared memory when multiple threads are involved;
* Implementing parsers for a given grammar and executing queries on a database.

In this assignment, I used:

- Use external libraries and APIs for data processing;
- Implement concurrent processing of related operations;
- Implement core computing abstractions such as caching;
- Parse and execute structured queries.

## 1: Implement `FSFTBuffer`
An **FSFTBuffer** can be used to implement a data cache.

## 2: Make `FSFTBuffer` **Thread-Safe**

## 3: `WikiMediator`

## 4: `WikiMediatorServer`

### Survivability Across Sessions

## 5: Structured Queries
